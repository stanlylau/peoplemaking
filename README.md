#### Background of creating this ebook

This book is so wonderful that I'd love to share and bring it with me for reference. However, there is no ebook version and it is not a common book available in bookstores. I decided to digitise it a chapter at a time before the official ebook version is out so that more people can benefit from Virginia Satir's work earlier.

This work is **not** to replace the official book and will stop when there is an official ebook available.
