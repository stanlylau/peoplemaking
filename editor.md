#Editor's Note

To me, Virginia Satir's writings are like homemade bread. They are yeasty, hearty, and nourishing. They promise much, taste wonderful, digest well, and thoroughly satisfy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why revise this book? Virginia describes the new material in her preface. I want to emphasize her devotion to peace in the world. By dipping into her own spiritual life, Virginia courageously tackles the difficult task of writing about peace and spirituality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with Virginia is a blessing for which I am deeply grateful. I also wish to thank Ann Austin Thompson, who carefully reviewed the manuscript; Betsy and Ellen Stevens, who brought a daughter's and mother's point of view to the new chapter on adolescence; and M. Ruth Whitcomb, who particularly attended to the chapter "The Later Years.
